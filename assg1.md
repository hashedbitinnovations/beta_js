1. Write code to display from 1 to 100 but just even numbers.


2. Write a function calculate which can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers. Use switch inside function.


3. You need to write a function findTax() that takes a number type variable as an argument which is the salary of a person. You need to calculate the tax amount on his salary by using the Js switch control flow. The tax rates are given below.

if 500000 >= salary > 0 then 0% tax on the entire salary.
If 1000000 >= salary > 500000 then 10% tax on the entire salary.
If 1500000 >= salary > 1000000 then 20% tax on the entire salary.
If the salary > 1500000 then 30% tax on the entire salary.


4. Write a function to perform this. You are given two numbers n1 and n2. You need to find the sum of the products of their corresponding digits. So, for a number n1= 6 and n2 = 34, you'll do (6*4)+(0*3) = 24.



Note - You can do it on VSCode/JSFiddle or any online tool.
